## âœ¨ Features <a name="features"></a>

- Use your React Context without the additional re-renders in the consumers
- Ability to read values out of context "on-the-fly" - useful in callbacks so you don't have to bind the UI to a context value change just to use the value in a callback

## About
React Context is a comfortable tool to use as a React developer because it comes bundled with React. And it uses a familiar pattern that you as a React develop enjoy. The [downsides](https://blog.thoughtspile.tech/2021/10/04/react-context-dangers/) of React Context are known and this was our approach at Air to solve it. We've looked at [other solutions](https://github.com/dai-shi/use-context-selector) but they've had too many issues/lacked features (like reading values on the fly) so we decided to roll our own.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save @air/react-memoized-context
```
```bash
yarn add @air/react-memoized-context
```

## Usage

1. Create types for your context:

- create type for value, which you want to store:
    ```typescript
    export interface User {
      id: string;
      name: string;
      score: number;
    }
    
    export interface UsersTeamContextValue {
      users: User[];
    }
    ```
- create type for actions you want to provide to update value:
    ```typescript
    export interface UsersTeamContextActions {
      addUser: (user: User) => void;
      assignScore: (userId: User['id'], score: number) => void;
    }
    ```
- create type for your context - remember to extend `MemoizedContextType`:
    ```typescript
    export interface UsersTeamContextType extends MemoizedContextType<UsersTeamContextValue>, UsersTeamContextActionsType {}
    ```
- create default value for your context:
  ```typescript
  export const defaultUsersTeamContextValue: UsersTeamContextType = {
    ...defaultMemoizedContextValue,
    getValue: () => ({
      users: [],
    }),
    addUser: () => {},
    assignScore: () => {},
   };
   ```
- create identifiers for your actions (like string const, enums or literal types)
```typescript
  export type UserTeamContextActions = 'addUser' | 'assignScore';
```
